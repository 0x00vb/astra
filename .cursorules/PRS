PRS — PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION (IEEE STYLE)

Product: Astra Intelligent Document Reasoning Platform
Version: 1.0
Standard: IEEE Std 830-1998–style articulation

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

This PRS defines the functional and non-functional requirements for Astra, an AI-powered document analysis platform integrating RAG, ReAct, vector search, and transformer inference. The platform provides explainable reasoning, multi-document synthesis, and interactive analysis via a modern UI.

1.2 Scope

The system allows users to upload documents, generate embeddings, execute semantic search, and interact with an AI agent that reasons over the data. The platform includes:

Document ingestion

Chunking & embedding

Vector storage & retrieval

ReAct-based agent reasoning

Chat interface with citations

Insights visualization

1.3 Definitions

RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

ReAct: Reasoning + Acting framework

Embedding: Numeric representation of text

Vector DB: ChromaDB or FAISS

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective

Astra is a standalone SaaS-style application consisting of:

Frontend UI: Next.js, Tailwind, ShadCN

Backend API: FastAPI

LLM Engine: Local LLaMA/Ollama or remote inference

Vector DB: Chroma/FAISS

2.2 User Classes

Technical analysts

Engineers

Consultants

Investigators

Data professionals

2.3 Product Functions

Document upload & text extraction

Embedding & indexing

Semantic Q&A

Evidence-grounded answers

Reasoning trace visualization

NFR-02 Security

Documents MUST remain local unless user chooses cloud mode.

NFR-03 Usability

UI MUST remain fully responsive for mobile & desktop.

NFR-04 Maintainability

All modules MUST be modular and isolated.

4. Constraints

Free-tier only infrastructure unless user upgrades.
